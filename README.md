A web app that evaluates the ability of a portuguese post to trigger controversy.

## About

The aim of this project is to analyze texts of articles or posts (specifically in Portuguese) to assess their potential to trigger controversy, and also to try to establish a relationship between the existence of derogatory/gross discourse in the comments and the feeling generated by the post (negative, positive or neutral).
